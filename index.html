Blueprint Africa is a group of volunteers and retired IT workers who have come together to help vulnerable people in the Global South to protect themselves from scams and cybercriminals.

Every year millions of dollars are lost in cyberscams.

We can get a volunteer to teach you security skills in a free informal meeting to show you how to protect yourself.
